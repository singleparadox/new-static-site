I'm a developer with 4 years of experience building scalable server-side systems using PHP (Laravel, Symfony), Python, and JavaScript. I’m comfortable with Git, Docker, and Kubernetes, and I focus on writing clean, maintainable code following OOP principles and design patterns.

I’ve mostly worked with GitLab for CI/CD but can easily adapt to new tools and workflows.
