    "description": "I'm currently a backend developer at synQup, where I've worked on a range of projects—from internal tools to customer modules. This role has given me exposure to a variety of codebases, from legacy systems to modern architectures. \n\nI've also handled data-intensive projects, including developing a module capable of processing millions of records efficiently. The only real limitation was PHP itself. Along the way, I’ve gained extensive experience with Docker, Kubernetes, and setting up CI/CD pipelines, which have become an integral part of my workflow."
